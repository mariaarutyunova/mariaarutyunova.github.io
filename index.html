								<p>In August 2023, I achieved a significant milestone by graduating from Hack Reactor's Software Engineering Certificate program. During this intensive course, I immersed myself in the fascinating world of programming, mastering languages and technologies such as Python 3, JavaScript ES6+, SQL, HTML5, CSS, React, React Hooks, Django 4, PostgreSQL, and FastAPI. But beyond just learning the technical skills, I embraced the creative and analytical challenges that come with software development. The projects I worked on became a playground for innovation, and I'm thrilled to <a href="#work">share some of them with you here</a>.</p>
								<p>Before my journey into coding, I was studying Criminal Justice at California State University, East Bay, where I graduated in 2020 with a B.S. in Criminal Justice. Despite my educational background, I always had a passion for computers and was fascinated by the way technology shapes our lives. While the legal field was appealing, I found myself drawn to the challenges and creative opportunities offered by software development. Enrolling in Hack Reactor was a pivotal decision, and it opened a door to a world of logical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. Combining my unique insights from the legal field with technical skills, I've found a fulfilling path where I can contribute in new and exciting ways. My experience has taught me to approach coding with a fresh perspective, and I'm excited about the endless possibilities and the positive impact I can make in the tech industry.</p>

								  <p>I had the distinct opportunity to collaborate with four talented developers on a project aimed at addressing food scarcity within communities. My specific contributions included the design and construction of the Neighborhood List, Neighborhood Form, and Pantry Detail pages using React. As well as writing the back-end points for Pantry and Pantry Item Requests using PostgresSQL and FastAPI. You can view the source code and further details of this project on  <a href="https://gitlab.com/fridgeraiders/community-fridges" target="_blank">GitLab</a>.</p>
								  <p>
									Inspired by a volunteer group in Los Angeles, we sought to create a platform that could facilitate the inventory management of community fridges and pantries. Our site enables users to register as volunteers or, if they prefer, anonymously explore local resources. Both volunteers and anonymous users can create check-ins, request items for the fridges and pantries, and engage in activities that support community sustenance.</p>
									<p>
									Beyond the technical achievement, this project provided a profound insight into how technology can be leveraged to create meaningful, real-world impact. Our hope is that this site could potentially become a valuable tool for the volunteer group in LA, and extend its reach to aid other communities in need. It was a privilege to use my skills to contribute to such a significant cause, and I've gained an even greater appreciation for the transformative power of technology.

								  <p>I worked on this project with one other software engineer. We created a website that helps dealerships not only manage their inventory but also manage sales and service. I personally worked on Sales backend and sales front-end. I also created the front-end pages for creating and listing Manafacturers and then creating and listing Automobiles. You can view the source code and further details of this project on  <a href="https://gitlab.com/mariaarutyunova/rev-realm" target="_blank">GitLab</a>.</p>
								  <p>This project used a Django backend and a React front-end. I also used some CSS, Bootstrap and Lottie Animations for the styling. </p>

							<p>Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio site! My passion for coding is matched only by my love for various hobbies that inspire me.</p>
							<p>When I'm not immersed in writing clean and efficient code, you can find me lost in the pages of a gripping novel, piecing together intricate jigsaw puzzles, or exploring new recipes in the kitchen. I also enjoy indulging in a good Netflix series, teaching myself to draw on ProCreate, and continually seeking new ways to challenge myself and grow.</p>
							<p>My diverse interests feed my creativity and problem-solving skills. I invite you to explore my portfolio and see how I've applied these skills to create unique and impactful solutions. Feel free to visit my contact me page if you would like to get in touch with me!</p>
